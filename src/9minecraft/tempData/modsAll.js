In the Naruto series, the Susano’o is a powerful, advanced form of the Sharingan that manifests as a giant, humanoid warrior encased in chakra. It is a unique ability among Uchiha clan members and has no direct connection to Kurama. Fan-made creations or modifications in the Naruto universe that involve combining Kurama and Susano’o might be found in fan fiction, fan art, or modding communities for Naruto video games, as these platforms often feature creative and imaginative ideas from fans. However, these are not official additions to the Naruto series and are created by fans for entertainment purposes. Kurama Addon (1.20, 1.19) will surprise you by smoothly combining Susano and Kurama, making them as a single, powerful entity.',

      'If you are a fan of Minecraft PE, you probably know that the End is the final dimension in the game, where you can face the Ender Dragon and explore the mysterious End Cities. But you may also agree that the End is not very exciting, as it is mostly a barren wasteland of purple islands and chorus plants. Even Mojang, the developer of Minecraft, admits that the End needs some improvement. That’s why a talented modder named [your name] has created Endcraft Remastered, an addon that will transform the End into a more diverse and dynamic place. Endcraft Remastered Addon (1.20) adds new biomes, structures, mobs, items, and features to the End, making it more fun and challenging to explore.',

      'Better Adventures Addon (1.20) serves as a mod designed to enhance the Minecraft world by introducing fresh biomes, variations to existing ones, new cultures, structures, ruins, animals, and even bosses. Rather than adhering to realism, it leans toward fantasy, featuring powerful magical items and creatures capable of performing magic. Most biomes aim for either an exaggerated natural feel or a sense of devastation, adding a touch of fantasy romanticism to the game. The Better Adventures add-on is an ambitious project that diversifies Minecraft by introducing numerous biomes, biome variants, trees, blocks, ores, mobs, and cultural elements. Unfortunately, we can’t delve into exhaustive details here, but suffice it to say that it significantly enriches the Minecraft experience.',

          'Show Spoiler -Underwater Ruins: Aquatic Embryo The Aquatic Embryo summons a baby dolphin pet to follow you around. Similar to Terraria’s pets, it’s invincible and you can only have one of them following you at a time. -Igloo: Curing Kit Curing Kits can be used to cure Zombie Villagers. Just interact with one, and it’ll start curing it without the use of golden apples and strength potions. You’ll find 2-4 of them at a time. -Dungeon: Dark Amulet Using the Dark Amulet will use up some of your HP in exchange for summoning a baby zombie minion. It is immune to the sun, and will protect you from other monsters until it dies. -Desert Temple: Dusty Lamp Similar to the Aquatic Embryo, the Dusty Lamp can be used to summon a small genie pet that will follow you around. Like the Baby Dolphin, you can only have one of them following you at a time. -Village: Encrusted Hammer Found in weaponsmith and toolsmith houses in villages, the Encrusted Hammer functions like a sword. It has about the same damage and durability as an iron sword, and can be repaired with emeralds. Attacking mobs with it has a small chance to make them drop emeralds. -Woodland Mansion: Fang Gauntlets The Fang Gauntlets deal 3 damage, and along with punching, you can right-click (or whatever your devices equivalent of right-clicking is) to use up some durability and summon a circle of fangs around yourself. -Nether Fortress: Fortress Armor Each piece of armor has the same durability and protection as iron armor. Wearing the full set will provide you with infinite fire protection. -Piglin Bastion: Gilded Arrow Holding the Gilded Arrow summons a ghast-like creature that will hover behind you. Right clicking with the arrow will make the creature fire a fireball. -Ruined Portal: Glowstone Totem Using the totem will trap all nearby monsters in a big block of fragile glowstone that will shatter after ten seconds. The totem can be used three times before it breaks. -Abandoned Mineshaft: Heavy Boots The heavy boots provides the same amount of protection as iron boots, and taking fall damage while wearing them will create a shockwave that damages mobs and cracks stone. -Pillager Outpost: Illager Warhorn Blowing the horn will give you the Bad Omen effect for a few seconds. Use it in a village to summon a raid. It can be used 3 times. -Jungle Temple: Jawsprout The jawsprout can be planted in soil like other crops, and can be grown with bonemeal. When fully grown, it will turn into a dangerous plant that will attack monsters for you. -Stronghold: Scaly Saddle Using the scaly saddle will summon a giant silverfish mount for you to ride. Jumping off of the mount will despawn it. It cannot be used in water. -Buried Treasure: Ship in a Bottle Similar to the scaly saddle, using the ship in a bottle will summon a squidboat mount for you to ride. Jumping off the mount will despawn it. It can be ridden on land, just very slowly. By putting it in a crafting table with four glowing ink sacs, you can make a Luminous Ship In A Bottle which will summon a Glowing Squidboat mount. -End City: Shulker Shellguard Crouching while standing completely still will summon a shield around you, at the cost of your vision. While shielded, you will be invincible. The armor can be dyed in a crafting table. -Shipwreck: Tentacutlass The tentacutlass deals the same damage as an iron sword, with a bit less durability. Attacking a mob with the sword will give you a few seconds of durability. -Ancient City: Sculk Statue By gathering blocks of sculk in the deep dark and feeding it to the statue, it will eat it in exchange for spitting out some xp for you. You can use the command “/function usl_items” to give yourself every item that the addon adds, with descriptions of what they do. I plan on adding more items as more structures are added to the game.',

Active and Passive Items: Items come in two flavors: active and passive. Active items require you to trigger them by crouching, while passive items automatically apply effects. Item Rarities: Discover items of varying rarity levels: common, rare, epic, and legendary. Each rarity tier offers unique benefits. Item Salvaging: Don’t fret if you find non-legendary items. You can salvage them into item dust, which serves multiple purposes. Use it to re-roll items, purchase other items, or unlock the special ability called InstaCharge. Item Drop Rates: Keep in mind that the chances of items dropping are not extremely high. Patience is key, and frustration is normal if you don’t get an item instantly. Creative Mode Testing: If you’re curious about the system, switch your gamemode to creative, spawn some mobs, and experiment. Just remember that the /kill command won’t work in this context. New boss: There are also different bosses (2 so far) that can randomly spawn in the shape of any hostile mob. Bosses are really tough and possess a bunch of cool and unique abilities. Killing them is the only way to obtain legendary items. Additionally, crates and similar things can spawn randomly in the world rewarding you with item dust and items as well as also posing threats occasionally. Furthermore, all mobs now have levels due to a leveling system. Particles indicate different levels and cause mobs to be tougher, faster, and stronger.',

        instruction:
          'It is the first add-on to introduce custom-made guns. The first ones to introduce the burst feature and silencers. Unlike other add-ons, they have “/playsound” for guns, meaning they will sound the same even if you are close or far from the sounds – this addon don’t do that here, it’s semi-realistic. The first ones to have draw sounds. When you shoot, villagers get scared (or if you hit with a certain melee or hold something scary, they will run). The first ones to Introduce custom scopes and iron sights. First Kill! Double Kill! Triple Kill! We’ve got those, We’ve got “Announcers”! Want to detect if you really hit that player? of course you do, we have “Hit Markers” Want a gun that harms people when you’re reloading? want a gun that shoots void bullets and makes your foes fly to their death? want a weapon that kicks people out of your world? We’ve got you covered! We’ve got more variety than every gun add-on combined, and best of all, they all have their own unique behaviors and stats! Unlike other creators on this site, we’ve got the determination in our mindsets that never keeps us stopping and we won’t take any breaks unless necessary. You can get items in survival mode from villagers. Dual Weapons! Decorate your gun with skins! Unlike other add-ons, the accuracy or recoil of guns gets worse as you move or jump. It’s very much like Counter-Strike! The add-on was based on DesnoGuns, a very nostalgic and old mod back in the day. Guess what? we have the artist who worked on the mod, and now he works in here! his name is Jun. We have the fastest rate of fire in all of Bedrock! The gameplay is unique and very fast-paced and every decision you do is risky, it’s quite competitive too. We have an automatic reload! It gets even better, we have reserve ammo like first-person shooters! The most polished gun add-on and bugs are a rare occurrence. “Better Guns” isn’t supported. Our textures are handmade, not ripped out of google and then re-edited to make it seem like you have made it. The fastest changing gun add-on of all time! Do you want to experience the first ever (real) Attachments on Bedrock? Actual Guns has them! (as a test, for the AWM as of now) Do you want to Enhance your gun stats without giving them abilities or changing their looks? you can also do that! AG is the first add-on to incorporate the first shot being accurate and later rounds being worse. We have DLCs that you can download to enhance your AG experience, or download guns or stuff that wouldn’t otherwise be added officially into the add-on.',

They are equipped with full iron armor and both a crossbow and an iron sword, they will switch between the two modes about the distance of the target. They are capable of swimming and breathing underwater, suffer no fall damage, and are easily controllable. They have 20 HP but also a passive regen. They target all monsters except endermen and phantoms. They target successful creepers. If tamed they attack anything that hurts the owner or is the target of the owner BUT THEY DO NOT target other guards or iron golems, nor other players, because they are neutral with all players. Players and other guards can’t damage them, so in an intense fight, you can fight without worrying of hitting them. To discard them use a wooden hoe. INTERACTIONS: -After enlisting they are in “PATROL MODE”, when in this mode they roam inside the village, like the iron golem would, if they get far from the village they are forced to return. If in the wild in this mode and a village is nearby they will go to the village, otherwise they roam patrolling freely. In this mode, they have an iron helmet equipped. -Interacting sneaking with a torch while they are in “PATROL MODE” put them in “SENTINEL MODE”, in this case, they will hold their ground no matter what and are forced into the ranged attack with their crossbow, they will have a leather helmet equipped. Sneak interact to revert. – You can hire them, “taming” them with an emerald block. When tamed they will accept MODE change, demobilization and despawn orders only from the owner, with all the benefits. They equip a shield to signal when are hired. – A hired guard can interact with a torch without sneaking to switch between “PATROL MODE” or “SENTINEL MODE” into “FOLLOWING MODE”. When following, the guard will equip a diamond helmet and will stay within 10 10-block radius from the owner, behaving like tamed wolves, but with a better following AI. -Leashing/Unleashing a guard also switches between “PATROL MODE” and “SENTINEL MODE”. -Interacting with an Iron Hoe will turn them back into a villager. -Interacting with a wooden Hoe will despawn them. -Interacting with baked potatoes or any cooked meat (except cooked chicken) will grant them 10 minutes of regeneration I. -Interacting with an iron ingot gives them strength 2 and resistance 1 for 10 minutes and resupply their armor if they break it. -Are tempted by torches, so if you hold one in your hand they will follow you closely ignoring everything else, useful for fine control when needed.',

          'Show Spoiler Is a new entity, a block statue, which stays put where you place it. IT MUST BE INSIDE A VILLAGE otherwise will explode. When placed it searches for other village controllers inside a 70-block radius, if found it will explode, this is because only one village controller is allowed per small village. It is crafted from 6 copper blocks and 3 emerald blocks. Cannot be damaged by players or guards and has 1000 hp, it is neutral to any mobs so ignored in fights. But if the village falls, (all the villagers are killed or all beds destroyed), it will fall. To discard it use a wooden hoe. The village controller acts as a “Resource collection point” for the village and will produce 13 vanilla products, one for each villager profession, placing the produce inside its inventory, that you can open. It has different textures to indicate when you are the owner, when it is chunkloading etc. Has the writing “IN” on top, indicating that it has also item hopper capabilities, so if you drop something on top or place a chest on top of it, it will siphon the content. If you place a hopper or use a minecart hopper below the controller, you can collect the resources and also sort them with your trusted vanilla sorting system. To have the produce you actually must have a relative profession in the village. I.e. Armorer produces raw iron, so if you have an armorer in the village, the controller will collect raw iron. Having more than one villager of the same profession doesn’t increase the controller production for the relative item. SIEGE DANGER: while the village controller is in the village and also a player is in the village there is a small chance an Illager raid will start. Statistically, a siege will happen by chance every 18 Minecraft days. Before you can do any of the following interactions, you must “tame” the controller with a GOLD INGOT, because only the owner of the controller will be able to do the following interactions: INTERACTIONS: -Interacting with a gold block, a siege will start. -Interacting with a wooden hoe will despawn it, destroying it. -Interacting with an emerald block will start a siege immediately but will also grant 15 days of chunkloading capabilities to the statue, in a 4-chunk radius. So the village can continue to produce while you are away. Win the siege first though…otherwise while the village is chunkloaded the enemies will continue to fight. After 15 Minecraft days of chunkloading the village controller will despawn. -Interacting with a single emerald, while the player has the effect hero of the village, will also grant 15 days of chunkloading capabilities in a 4-chunk radius removing the hero effect from the player. After 15 Minecraft days of chunk loading the village controller will despawn. -Interacting with a nether star will eliminate any siege danger chance for that particular controller, but it will not be able to chunkload. (Mutually exclusive with emerald unloading and dragon egg) -Interacting with a dragon egg will let the controller chunkload a 6-chunk radius forever, but normal siege danger is still possible.

While in this mode they break blocks in a surface of 5×3, so you can ride them to quickly quarry a large area, but keep in mind that while in this mode they move very slowly, so you will need a lot of coal. Note that activating the MINING MODE will damage 30 HP from the golem, so you will need to repair it with iron from time to time. -Interacting with a fire charge gives them 60 seconds of powerful ranged attack, “CANNON MODE”, they use explosive bolts that deal 25 hp of damage, also their engaging range is very high. Note that they will not fire while in cannon mode if you ride them, they will find their targets themselves. -If one of the two advanced functions is enabled if you interact with a torch without sneaking will disable either the mining mode or the cannon mode.',

While they are not fueled: -Interacting with a torch makes it slightly bigger and capable of pulling in up to 9 guards and golems in the right seat, so you can transport them easily, interact again with a torch while the engine is off to revert to normal transporting mode, forcing the passengers to dismount; -Interacting with 1 WHEAT makes it slightly bigger and capable of pulling in up to 2 of any entity, useful to transport villagers and animals, interact with a torch while the engine is off to revert to normal transportation mode, forcing all the passengers to dismount; -Interacting with 1 NETHERRACK makes it way bigger and capable of pulling in up to 9 guards and golems in the right seats, this mode is intended for use on the lava because with this size you can float over lava safely inside a mule.

CREEPER They don’t drop gunpowder anymore (see later how to produce it) unless they are killed with a looting weapon. This is for balance reasons. TNT RECIPE is now 9 gunpowder. SHULKER BOXES, ENDER CHESTS, BOWS Have their recipe altered, they are much more expensive, for balance reasons. POWERED RAILS, RAILS Have now alternate recipes, normal rails in particular can be crafted either with iron or with copper, the copper recipe uses also coal. GOLD INGOTS, GOLD NUGGET One gold ingot makes 4 gold nuggets and 4 gold nuggets make a gold ingot. SEA LANTERN They require only 5 prismarine crystals. PIGLINGS Now they detect enemies further (24 range instead of vanilla 16) and are aggravated also by breaking nether quartz ore and Ancient Debris. ZOMBIE PIGMEN They are aggravated by breaking nether ores the same as Piglings. BLAZE POWDER now requires 9 blaze rods to craft 1 blaze powder, this is for balance reasons and also because blaze powder has very high-tech uses (see manufacturing system cleric chain). SMOKERS, BLAST FURNACES, BREWING STANDS are now much, much more expensive to craft because they are now treated as the machines of the new “Manufacturing System” (See later). Also, the things that smokers and blast furnaces do in vanilla can be done with a normal furnace, so a new use for them is nice. HOPPERS Can also be crafted with 8 copper ingots. FIRE CHARGE the recipe is modified, involving 1 TNT and 1 firework rocket. When shot from a dispenser it is an exploding cannon shell. ELYTRA Can be duped with a recipe, like armor trims. The recipe needs phantom membranes. PHANTOM MEMBRANE Is craftable with 1 copper ingot and 2 coal ENCHANTED GOLDEN APPLE Can be duped using lapis blocks TRIDENT Can be crafted with iron and prismarine shards; NAUTILUS SHELL Can be crafted with prismarine shards; ARMOR TRIMS can be duped with 8 leather instead of all those diamonds, except for the netherite armor upgrade. POTTERY SHERDS can be duped with 8 prismarine blocks. SHULK SENSORS can be crafted from observers and some other materials. NETHER QUARTZ has a lot of more uses, in particular, can be used to craft overworld ores, in various combinations. This gives a reward to dangerously mine in the nether (piglings and pigment are now aggravated to mining nether quartz!). Nether quartz can be used in a blast furnace to turn it into Amethyst or in a smoker to turn it into coal. CHAINMAIL ARMOR now graphically appears like a copper armor and it is crafted with copper. COBWEBS are craftable with 9 strings LAPIS to experience Lapis in a blast furnace turn into enchanted bottles. Fire potion and saddle in the smoker the first is turned into a water bottle, the second in a coal block. (This is because of balance reasons and changes to piglin barter)',

        instruction:
          'Show Spoiler As stated before, the village controller will collect items for each villager that has a profession, villagers with the same profession will only collect for one. Villagers can have one of 13 professions in vanilla, excluding unemployed and nitwits, the latter are automatically turned into guards if they grow up into nitwits. The collection cycle is distributed in the Minecraft day, for a total of two cycles, one during the day and one during the night. So for example the farmer will produce at sunrise and sunset, while the librarian at midday and midnight etc. The village controller will place the produce in its inventory that you can access but you can also place a hopper or minecart with a hopper below the village controller block statute, so you can automatically sort the items with a vanilla sorting system or minecart hopper system to distribute for your uses. Each of the items produced by the villagers can then be further processed inside Smokers, Blast Furnaces or Brewing stands to manufacture more refined products in often long manufacturing chains that you can automate using all vanilla systems (auto smelters, hopper item filters, minecart systems, etc. Let’s see the production chains in detail: -TOOLSMITH: [Produces 16 – 32 mangrove logs per cycle, which can be transmuted into any other overworld log using the stonecutter], Mangrove logs can be further processed into the following SMOKER chain: Charcoal [which can be transmuted into Ice using any stonecutter] Obsidian [which can be transmuted into Packed ice using any stonecutter] Crying Obsidian [which can be transmuted into blue ice using any stonecutter] Coal Firework rocket Putting mangrove logs in a blast furnace turns them into dried kelp. -STONE MASON: [Produces 64 – 128 cobblestones per cycle] that can be further processed in the following BLAST FURNACE chain to have: Stone [which can be transmuted in any stonecutter into Deepslate and cracked stone bricks] Refined Stone [which can be transmuted in any stonecutter into andesite, diorite, and granite] Quartz block [which can be transmuted in any stonecutter into Refined quartz block, Tuff, Calcite, and dripstones] (note that the quartz block can’t be crafted into nether quartz, which is a more high-tier material than a block with only aesthetic purposes. Putting cobblestone in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -LEATHER WORKER: [Produces 64 – 128 gravel per cycle] that can be further processed in the BLAST FURNACE to have the following chain: Sand [which can be transmuted in red sand in any stonecutter] Glass [which can be transmuted into Tinted glass in any stonecutter] Sandstone [which can be transmuted into Red Sandstone and any color concrete powder in any stonecutter] Smooth Sandstone [ which can be transmuted into Red Smooth Sandstone and any color concrete in any stonecutter] Flint [which can be further processed into a smoker to obtain a mangrove log] Putting gravel in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -FISHERMAN: [Produces 64 – 128 dirt per cycle] that can be further processed in the BLAST FURNACE to have the following chain: Mud [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into mangrove roots and mud with roots] Clay block [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into compact mud and mud bricks] Bricks [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into terracotta and single brick] Prismarine [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into all other pristine variants] Putting dirt in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -CARTOGRAPHER: [Produces 64 – 128 netherrack per cycle] that can be further processed in the BLAST FURNACE to have the following chain: Nether Brick [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into all variants of Nether Bricks] Endstone [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into purpura block] Blackstone [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into Basalt and Polished Basalt] Soul Terrain [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into soul sand] Putting netherrack in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -FLETCHER: [Produces 12 – 24 sugar canes per cycle] that can be further processed in the BLAST FURNACE to have the following chain: Podsol [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into all flower types, all dirt types, leaves variants, and other biota] Crimsom Stem [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into warped stem, all alliums variants and warts variants] Bone meal Brown fungus Red fungus Crimson fungus Warped Fungus Gunpowder Putting sugar cane in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -SHEPHERD: [Produces 12 – 24 honeycomb per cycle] which can be further processed in a BLAST FURNACE to have the following chain: White wool slime [Slime blocks can be transmuted in a stonecutter into honey blocks] Feather Ink sak Glow Ink sac Leather String Putting honeycomb in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -FARMER: [produces 6 -12 pumpkins per cycle] which can be further processed in a SMOKER to have the following chain: Melon Wheat Carrot Cocoa [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into a cookie, sweet berries, and gold berries] Apple Potato Baked Potato [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into bread] Honey bottle [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into beetroot soup or mushroom soup[ Pumpkin pie [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into rabbit stew] Cake Raw Porkchop [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into any raw meat or fish] Putting pumpkins in a blast furnace turns them into dried kelp. -BUTCHER: [Produces 8 – 16 raw copper per cycle] which can be further processed in a BLAST FURNACE to have the following chain: Copper ingot Glowstone block Lantern Shroomlight Ochre light [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into other foglight variants] Sea Lantern End Rod Redstone Putting raw copper in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -LIBRARIAN: [Produces 2 -4 raw gold per cycle] which can be processed into a gold ingot in a blast furnace Putting raw gold in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -ARMORER: [Produces 4 – 8 raw iron per cycle] which can be processed into an iron ingot in a blast furnace Putting raw iron in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -WEAPONSMITH: [has 50% chance of producing a diamond per cycle] Putting diamonds in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -CLERIC: [Produces exactly 2 ghast tears per cycle, which is a very powerful substance now] Putting ghast tears in a smoker turns them into mangrove planks [fuel]. Ghast tears can be obtained also from prismarine shards and by putting in stonecutter echo shards, disk fragments, shook shriekers, and catalysts. When placed in a BLAST FURNACE ghast tears turn into Lingering potions of swiftness, which is not stackable but can be hopper automated as input of brewing stands, this solution can be put in a BLAST FURNACE to turn it back to Ghast tears, which is a stackable item. The lingering potions of swiftness are the input that can be used in the brewing stands bottom slots for advanced manufacturing (doubling and even tripling the reagent] when used with the following reagents (top slots): Diamonds Gold ingots Iron Ingots Copper Ingots Ender Pearls Spider Eyes Magma Cream Rabbit Foot Pufferfish Scute Blaze Powder Quartz Lapis Almost every item you can manufacture using the manufacturing chains can be sold to villagers for emeralds, the revenue is higher the further the item is in the production chain and the villager level is, i.e. you can trade to the level 2 Shepherd 21 wool for an emerald but also to the lvl 4 shepherd 9 leather for an emerald, so if you process the wool in the blast furnace chain from that 21 wool you can obtain 21 leather which is 2 at least 2 emeralds instead of 1 with 3 spare leather remaining. SMOKER USAGE: Processing in blast furnaces requires fuel though, so you need to power them, you can use any vanilla fuel or you can use SMOKERS to produce fuel. As described above, SMOKER chains can process TOOLSMITH PRODUCE and FARMER PRODUCE turning them into refined fuels or refined food respectively, but SMOKERS can process also all produce of the other villagers turning them into MANGROVE PLANKS to be recycled as fuel for your smokers and furnaces. So if you make an item sorter to collect items from the village controller you don’t need an incinerator at the end of the hopper chain, you can put everything into a smoker to recycle them into useful fuel, it is a good way to use materials you don’t need, for example, lots of netherrack to turn it into fuel, processing it in the SMOKER. Other than all the primary products, smokers can turn the following into fuel: Cobbled deepslate, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff, calcite, sand, glass, sandstone, polished sandstone, basalt, Blackstone, soul terrain and soul sand, Ice, Podsol, stems, and terracotta you find in mesa biomes.',

      'Minecraft’s current farming system is quite basic, and many players believe that the game needs a Farming Update. Fortunately, there are several addons available that can enhance Minecraft farming. One such addon is the Advanced Farming Addo. Advanced Farming Addon (1.20, 1.19) brings several cool features to improve Minecraft farming, including a tractor that is very functional when used with its super functional tools for plowing, planting, and harvesting. The tractor is complete with fueling and fuel consumption mechanics. This addon also includes all the fuel-making mechanics for fueling the tractor, and you can get it both in survival and creative game modes. There are also some new foods, including goat meat. The goat itself is the only animal in the addon currently. This addon took a while to complete and will receive updates in the future, including new animals.',

After the Calcite Golem has Arrows, it will start shooting them at Monsters. When the Golem shoots an Arrow, the Arrow gets used up, meaning it disappears from its inventory. The Calcite Golem ONLY shoots normal Arrows. No Potion Tipped Arrows, no Fire Charges, no Tridents, just normal Arrows. You CANNOT pick up Arrows that the Calcite Golem has shot.

Additionally, 2 Players can ride it at the cost of only a single Saddle, as opposed to one Saddle a person, like a Strider. You can also control the Basalt Golem like you would a Horse, no special item required. The Basalt Golem is faster in lava than it is on land. It’s really slow on land. The Basalt Golem has trouble climbing up blocks, but if you hold out some Basalt, or tie it to a Lead, that should help it get up blocks. You can heal the Basalt Golem with Basalt.

          'Show Spoiler The Netherrack Golem is a small, Neutral Golem that can shoot fireballs and fly. The Netherrack Golem is a very mischievous Golem that runs on a timer. For 30-60 seconds, it just flies around, minding its own business. But after that time is up, it starts to attack random mobs that it sees. It just flies after them and shoots fireballs. And what’s even worse is that after it shoots a fireball, it will do a very annoying laugh. It will even attack Players. However, once another 30-60 seconds is up, it goes back to just flying around. It will also attack anything that attacks it first, including Players. Now, the reason why Netherrack Golems are useful is this: You can tame the Netherrack Golem with Magma Cream. Once it’s tamed, the Golem will follow you around. It will follow you faster if you hold Magma Cream in your hand. Once you have a tamed Netherrack Golem, if you attack a mob, the Netherrack Golem will also attack that mob by shooting fireballs at it (It still does the laugh, though). However, the Netherrack Golem will not immediately attack a mob if the mob attacks you. Netherrack Golems also spawn naturally in the Nether, so if you have the Magma Cream on hand, you can hire some help. Although, there is a catch to this deal. If you don’t have the Netherrack Golem attack anything in 3-5 minutes, it will get bored and start to attack you! After it stops attacking you, you have to re-tame it if you still want its help.',

After half a Minecraft day (10 minutes.), the block will grow back. The better the Pickaxe, the more Lapis Lazuli is dropped. The Lapis Lazuli Golem will attack Undead mobs, but it will also attack Iron Golems, Villagers, Wolfs, Wandering Traders, and above all else, it’s sworn enemy, the Redstone Golem. Lapis Lazuli Golems and Redstone Golems hate each other and will kill each other. Lapis Lazuli Golems, under no circumstances, will ever attack Illagers. Initially, the Lapis Lazuli Golem won’t attack you, but if you hurt it, then it will try to kill you, so be careful when you are swinging that pickaxe to ‘Mine’ the Lapis Lazuli off the Golem.',

The Netherite Golem has 3 attacks, 1 ranged and 2 melees. Its ranged attack is it spits 2 large Fireballs at you. Its common melee attack is it slams its fists into the ground and creates a shockwave weaker than the Diamond Golem, but it does more damage. The second melee attack is it summons Lava in a circle around it. The Netherite Golem is fire and explosion-resistant and can walk on Lava. The author tried as hard as he could to make it so you can’t cheat against the Golem. For example, the Netherite Golem creates a thin stone layer under it when it is on Water, which allows it to walk over bodies of Water.

          'Limitless: This is a natural technique that comes from the Gojo family. It lets its users control space almost completely by using cursed energy at the smallest level. This leads to many different results and techniques within the main ability. Besides the basic level of controlling space, Limitless has three normal and one “abnormal” form. Infinity: This is the normal form of Limitless, and it is often called the ability to stop. But this is not true, because the real power of Infinity is to slow things down. When something tries to hit Satoru, it actually hits the endless space between them and him. Satoru explains that this is like the sum of an infinite series and it comes from the puzzle of Achilles and the turtle. Just like Achilles can never catch the turtle because there are always smaller and smaller spaces between them, or how the number one can never touch the number two because there are endless fractions between them, the enemy can never touch Satoru because of the infinity between them. Satoru can choose what touches him and what doesn’t, based on things like size, speed, and danger. Cursed Technique Lapse Blue: This is a stronger version of the normal Limitless; Blue is what happens when Gojo makes the Limitless and negative energy stronger, creating an empty space. Because of this, the world has to fix itself and fill in the empty space, making all matter in that space come together. Cursed Technique Reversal Red: This is the opposite of Blue, Red does the opposite thing. By using his reversal technique to change the properties of Blue, Satoru makes his infinity split apart and causes a very strong pushing force, pushing away',

      'Are you tired of waiting for your health to regenerate after eating food? Do you want to heal faster? If so, consider using an addon that can help you heal more quickly. Minecraft Java Saturation Addon (1.20, 1.19) addon won’t modify other food types that don’t give health. In Minecraft, a health point is equal to half a heart. So, if the food has about 6 health points, it will give out 3 hearts in total. Similarly, a hunger point is equal to half a hunger bar. So, if the hunger point value is 6, it is also 3 hunger bars. It’s worth noting that Sus Stew is currently untouched due to the existence of many variants of the stew.',

Crab Addon (1.20) adds the first mob – crab, to the game, which has one gigantic claw that it likes to wave around as it scuttles through its home in the mangrove swamp. This giant claw is special because if a player manages to find one, they can use it to place blocks further away. The crab is important to the mangrove swamp ecosystem and can be found hiding between the vines of this mud-tactic biome. If you’re going to play hide and seek with this potential new mob, then keep your eyes peeled!',

There will likely be several different colors of crabs, including red, blue, orange, green, and even the rarest crab with a 1 in 2000 chance (albino crab). You can feed and propagate crabs with fish or dried seaweed. Since they are crabs, they can jump from liana to liana in the mangroves. Crabs can attack a player with their huge claw, but they can also attack each other. If a crab dies, there is a 100% chance that its claw will fall out of the crab, which allows it to further place blocks. There is a chance that the crab will have a different leading claw, right or left. Crabs can live on land for a while, but not for long. After a while, they will die.',

You are teleported to a random height every time with a water bucket or slime where you have to jump from the top to the ground safely. If you hit the ground, you get damaged or even die. In MLG Water Bucket Jump Challenges Addon (1.20, 1.19), there are lots of bucket jump challenges and some traps in this addon, so be careful. You can also play with your friends. In this version, 5 new platforms and heights have been added, including the cobweb jump challenge where you have to place 3 or 4 webs to safely land.',

Goblin Traders Addon (1.20, 1.19) is based on the Java mod and also includes the goblin trader from the end dimension.

There are three types of goblins: “Goblin Trader – Overworld”, “Vein Goblin Trader – Nether” and “End Goblin Trader – End”. Some of their best trades are the ability to exchange for “Picks”, “Axes”, “Shovels” and “Armors” that are stronger than the normal ones in the game.',

The creator’s goal was to create a challenging final boss for experienced players who want a non-spawning boss in their worlds. The only way to spawn the boss is through creative mode. The boss has extremely high damage and max health, making it nearly impossible to defeat alone with vanilla weapons. It is recommended to have at least 20 damage points weapons and to play with a group of three players. Additionally, it is recommended to use other addons that add better weapons and gear.

These are the Gloomy Zombie, the Gloomy Skeleton, the Gloomy Creeper, and the Gloomy Spider. These mobs have different abilities and behaviors than their normal counterparts, such as being faster, stronger, smarter, or more explosive. They also have a dark and gloomy appearance, with glowing eyes and particles. New items: The add-on also adds two new items that can be obtained from the new mobs. These are the Gloomy Bone and the Gloomy Gunpowder. These items can be used to craft new weapons and tools, such as the Gloomy Sword, the Gloomy Bow, the Gloomy Arrow, and the Gloomy TNT. These weapons and tools have special effects and advantages over their normal versions, such as dealing more damage, having longer ranges, or causing bigger explosions. New biomes: The add-on also modifies some of the existing biomes in the game, making them more gloomy and spooky. These are the Gloomy Forest, the Gloomy Swamp, the Gloomy Desert, and the Gloomy Plains. These biomes have different colors, vegetation, structures, and sounds than their normal versions, creating a more eerie and mysterious atmosphere. They also have a higher chance of spawning new mobs, making them more dangerous to explore. New structures: The add-on also adds some new structures that can be found in the modified biomes. These are the Gloomy Mansion, the Gloomy Temple, the Gloomy Pyramid, and the Gloomy Village. These structures have different designs, loot, traps, and secrets than their normal versions, offering more rewards and challenges for adventurous players. They also have a higher chance of spawning new mobs, making them more risky to enter. New mechanics: The add-on also changes some of the existing mechanics in the game, making them more realistic and immersive. These are the Day-Night Cycle, the Weather System, the Lighting System, and the Sound System. These mechanics have different effects and impacts on the gameplay than their normal versions, such as making the nights longer and darker, making the weather more unpredictable and dynamic, making the lighting more realistic and dramatic, and making the sound more immersive and directional.',

      'Weapons from Minecraft Dungeons Addon (1.20, 1.19) adds to Minecraft Bedrock edition all the weapons that are in Minecraft Dungeons. Currently, this mod is in development and it adds only 69 new weapons out of 155. So far, this mod is only 40% done, but it is already quite large-scale and adds a lot. At the time of release, this mod will become very large-scale in terms of the amount of content added to the game. Many items that this mod adds have a texture with a resolution of more than 16×16 pixels, and in order for them to be displayed correctly in Minecraft, the author made a 3D model separately for each of these items. All the items this mod adds can be crafted and obtained in survival mode. (At the moment, bows cannot be obtained in Survival Mode and can only be used in Creative Mode. It will be fixed in the next update.',

They are very protective of their master – following closely and attacking any monsters that get too close.

An airborne-tamed elemental wolf will fall to the ground if told to sit. These guys can fly and will switch to flight mode when targeting a mob or being ridden. They’re still learning proper flight skills though, so be very careful not to allow them to fly away.

There is a tactical sprint like Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2019. The addon has a good balance, which does not give a unique advantage when choosing another weapon. Do you want to see the correct animations from the first person, then this is in the addon. Each weapon has a pleasant recoil. Each weapon has its own animations, both from the first and third person. You can get absolutely all items both in creative and by buying them from villagers and trade tables in survival. Weapons from my other projects are being added and will be added to this addon, starting with the Project [Company] map.

    description:
      'The Epic Knights Addon (1.20, 1.19) is a realistic medieval armor and weapons mod that adds a total of 16 armor sets and 20 weapon types using vanilla resources and a new material called steel. It is inspired by the java Epic Knights Mod by Magistu and is compatible with the 3D Combat Addon by pixelleddoki for enhanced attack animations and abilities. We recommend using 3D combat with the Epic Knights mod for an even more immersive combat experience. Most of the weapons in the mod also have the ability to block attacks. When used correctly, this mod adds a unique and historical touch to Minecraft.',

      'Mob Battles Addon (1.20, 1.19) addon for Minecraft PE is a unique and interesting tool that allows players to create dynamic and engaging battles within the game. Developed by Juaneitor 22, this addon provides players with a variety of sticks that can be used to manipulate entities in the game. The addon includes several different types of sticks, each with its own unique function. For example, the “Kill Entity” stick allows players to instantly kill any entity, while the “Raid Stick and Raid Initializer” can be used to start a raid. The “Debug Stick” allows players to edit entity components like scale, health, movement, and name, while the “Tamer Setter” and “Rider Setter” sticks can be used to create fights of riders, such as a skeleton riding a spider versus a Pillager riding a ravager.',

Additionally, an easter-egg has been added, which gives the hl2 weapon loadout when the function “/function impulse 101” is used. This mod adds an array of Combine Units, with more aliens yet to come. As of now, the current aliens in the game are only the antlion and head crabs. The head crab zombie conversion for rebels will be added in the future. The mod also adds the iconic weaponry from H2 along with their respective ammo types, as well as the HEV suit which has maxed armor points and regen.',

If thrown to an item directly they´ll just pick it up and return, it without attacking entities. If they hit an entity directly when thrown, they latch onto it and start attacking it, this works differently from them just chasing and melee attacking their target. Pikmin will basically stick to their target, which allows them to damage even flying enemies, they attack and deal damage in a set interval, and their attacks won´t deal knockback but can ignore invincibility frames, so stacking many Pikmin in a single target can rank up the damage. Pikmin latched onto something can´t be damaged by their target, but if said target moves too much, or attacks them, they can shake off the Pikmin from themselves, which will get flung away and keep attacking regularly, but now vulnerable to damage, this all in conjunction makes more efficient to hit enemies directly with Pikmin for combat porpuses. If thrown into a plant-like or mushroom-like non-full block, they´ll start harvesting that kind of block, basically, they´ll find all nearby blocks of that type they can break them, take some of their drops, and keep going until there´s nothing left, the return to you inventory with the items they collected. When doing this they´ll ignore non-fully grown crops, so you can just throw one at your wheat farm to harvest all without fear of breaking crops still to grow, some of the blocks they can harvest are grass, flower, crops, nether wart, bamboo, sugar cane, nether roots, crimson fungus, big drop leaves, nether wart, etc, there are many blocks they can help you harvest quicker and you should try by yourself.',

White Pikmin are quite rare, but their poisonous touch and magic immunity make up for it, once alone can kill any regular enemy, and are more effective than other types against witches, wither skeletons, and cave spiders, the only drawback is that all their power comes from the wither effect they inflict, so against enemies with higher health they are not as effective, as stacking more than ones into a single target barely increases the damage it suffers.',

Their higher density also makes them heavier, which on the one hand makes them way slower than other types and fall faster when thrown, so they can´t reach as high or as far, but on the other hand they are immune to all kinds of knockback, and probably their best trait, while thrown their weight creates a powerful shockwave upon hitting anything that deals 4 damage ignoring invincibility frames to anything in a 2 block radius besides other Pikmin and their owner, and can stun for 2 seconds with a 50% chance, and can stack with more purple being thrown in quick succession. One last not combat-based trait, purple Pikmin have a special throw mode, if you sneak and throw one at any entity it won’t damage it, instead using their strength they pick up said entity and carry it while following you until you call them back with your whistle or for some reason the entity dies, if called they´ll drop in on whatever spot they are and come back to you, which basically lets you transport mobs easier than using leads and boats, or just stop enemies on their tracks since purple Pikmin do keep their distance when carrying an entity. Purple Pikmin are a rare type but are worth going through the trouble to find, they are the best fighters, being able to easily solo regular enemies, shred through hordes of them or single big chunky targets by just spamming them, and being able to carry mobs useful into itself, for many probably the best type of all.',

Unfortunately, even if they are hard to hit, winged Pikmin don´t deal that much damage, only 1 per hit, don´t get me wrong, they can still kill stuff, and being able to fly and get chased to airborne enemies like phantoms and ghast, instead to having to latch on into them only to fall shortly after when they get shaken off, gives them a niche in combat, but their damage still leaves much to be desired, luckily for you, if you can´t wait for flying Pikmin to finish off those pesky ghast and phantom, you can do it yourself with their help… Finally, their last ability, Pikmin you are holding on either your main or off-hand are able to carry you and slow down your fall, you can avoid this if you sneak in case you need to, and by holding winged Pikmin on both hands and pressing the jump button, they´ll actually be able to carry you up and let you fly, now, you can´t fly infinitely, doing this tires them up and depletes their stamina, which only recovers when you are on the ground, but you can still fly for a considerable amount of time, and even if their stamina runs out they´ll still slow down your fall, you´ll just have to wait for it to recharge before being able to ascend again.',

Besides producing Pikmin, onions also work as their home and can store Pikmin of their color safely, there are two ways to do this, you can drop Pikmin near an onion so they become lost and enter it, and then sneak and interact with the onion to take them out one by one, the second way is by using the onion´s interface. If you hit an onion you own, something like this will appear, one toggle and two sliders, the first slider lets you toggle or not the option for Pikmin to exit the onion on their own, something I´ll explain later, the sliders work to specify a set amount of Pikmin to withdraw or deposit on the onion, you just need to enter the interface, use the right toggle, set an amount and press submit, you should use just one toggle, but using both works fine, if you, for example, say you wanna deposit 5 Pikmin but withdraw 10. you just withdraw 5 since is the net result, so you won´t break anything, the right math is done to prevent that, you just waste a bit of time.

First, to make a colony you need to have Pikmin inside your onion, then sit it and allow Pikmin to come out, just with that you make a colony, Pikmin in a colony will come out during the day and reenter the onion at night, they normally just wander around, but can be attacked by hostile mobs excluding creepers, and will defend themselves from them, but this rarely happens unless forced by the player, due to them spending the night inside the onion. If an onion is made stand up and start flying while Pikmin are outside, all Pikmin will reenter the onion and not come out until you make it land again, this makes relocating onions with colonies easy, they´ll also reenter the onion if you toggle off the option for Pikmin to exit the onion on their own, again you can do this from the interface or by using the whistle on the onion. Pikmin in colonies can´t be called or picked up by any player if you as their owner want to use them, you first need to make them reenter the onion, then withdraw them from there, the faster way is to make the onion stand up, take the as much as you have and need, and then make it sit again.

Totaling 10 Hammers, 10 Megas Axes, and 10 Megas Hoes, of course, all based on the Java mod and how much with a 2d and 3d version of the plugin. In this update of the plugin, we add new useful tools for different things, the hammer is useful to chop the blocks and minerals faster since it does it in 3 × 3, and the hoes serve more to cultivate faster, remove grass and leaves as well. 3×3 and finally there would be the axes that are used to cut large amounts of wood by just cutting 1 block of wood.',

In addition, several types of armor will appear so that the player can resist such powerful creatures. 6th Century is a Mod created by Kyuu Desperation to recreate a Classified File from the Britannia Government of the 7th World.

Warden can detect vibrations and sounds of a helicopter but does not get agitated (for some reason). Basic Facts: This Helicopter is similar to your world’s Mosquito Helicopters, though some parts are noticeably different. One example of the difference is Seat Capacity, most of your world’s Mosquito Helicopters have only 1 Seat which is for the Pilot. Ermanaric A1 has 2 seats cause instead of having its purpose being just a Personal Helicopter (which fun fact you can get in America for the minimum of $2K), it is also used by the Germanics (Imperial Germans) as a Scout Helicopter to use whilst Trench Warfare was still manageable in the 2nd Great War. Operating System: Starting Helicopter: A helicopter can be started or Stopped if the Rider is riding it and the Helicopter is on the ground. You can only stop its engine and the whole helicopter itself on the ground as this avoids the sudden death of falling from the sky. When Aboard the Helicopter, you can turn on its power and engine to start. But it can take a maximum of 25 Seconds until you can fly. Flight Controls: You can change the helicopter’s Altitude by looking up or down. You can also make the helicopter stay on its current Altitude by wearing a special type of head equipment. Head Item Controller: 7th World Helicopter Pilot Helmet. This Flight Altitude Stabilizer is only available for Machines and the Flying Animal, Hippogriff. Recommended: It is recommended that only the Pilot shall wear the Item controller. Visual Animations: Main Rotors: Main Rotors when helicopter is going up has its Main Rotors tilt 30+ degrees. Main Rotors will return to 0 degrees if helicopter is going down. Lights: Lights will start blinking on the Tail Boom, cockpit, and Cabin. Tail Rotors: It spins faster than the main Rotors. Cyclic: Cyclic moves forward, and sideways, just like how real helicopters are operated. All Rotors: All Rotors Spin so fast that you can visually see it is spinning in the Opposite Direction. Whole Helicopter: It Tilts a little when it goes Forward, or sideways movements. Cockpit: Buttons for certain Actions can light up to darken, and some lights show the Engine, Fuel, Health, and States of the Helicopter.',
